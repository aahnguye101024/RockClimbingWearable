# RockClimbingWearable

The rock climbing wearable should serve as a portable device worn around one's waist when they rock climb. Operating with a lipo battery, this device uses an active GPS device, an OLED screen, and a TEENSY-LC to track your vertical distance climbed for your own training purposes.
